This project is one of the possible projects for the course Hacking for Social Sciences (and the Humanities) by Matt Bannert. You can find the other projects of the class at this link.

I am a Zurich born and raised Masters student at the University of Zurich and a Research Assistant at the KOF Swiss Economic Institute. Apart from studying my passions are football Figure 2.1: This was a savenot a goal and theatre sports. Figure 2.2: Did I hear someone laughing? 2.2 My Research My first and latest research project is about short-term forecasting of quarterly Swiss exports with monthly indicators: When the aim is to forecast quarterly overall Swiss exports, does forecast accuracy improve when forecasting different subcomponents of quarterly Swiss exports separately and aggregating afterwards (disaggregate approach) instead of targeting overall quarterly Swiss exports directly (aggregate approach)? Aggregate approach: Forecast quarterly Swiss exports (as published by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO) directly. Disaggregate approach 1: Forecast quarterly Swiss goods exports and quarterly Swiss services exports (both as published by the SECO) separately and aggregate the two forecasts afterwards. Disaggregate approach 2: Forecast the following exports subcategories separately and aggregate them afterwards: Quarterly Swiss pharmaceutical and chemical goods exports (as constructed following SECO) Quarterly Swiss machinery and electronics goods exports (as constructed following SECO) Quarterly Swiss watches, precision instruments and bijouterie goods exports (as constructed following SECO) Quarterly Swiss miscellaneous goods exports (as constructed following SECO) Quarterly Swiss services exports (as published by SECO) Forecasting models: Unrestricted mixed data sampling (U-MIDAS) following Foroni et al. (2015) in combination with forecast pooling following Timmermann (2006) Mixed-frequency dynamic factor model (MF-DFM) following Giannone et al. (2008) and Banbura et al. (2011) based on the R-package of de Valk et al. (2019) Optional: Factor MIDAS following Marcellino and Schumacher (2010) Benchmark forecasting models: Rolling in-sample mean, AR model See how the Swiss total exports evolved over time: ## Warning in rect(xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop, col = col, ...): graphical ## parameter &quot;type&quot; is obsolete Figure 2.3: Total Swiss export growth.

We try to integrate advances from climate studies into the economic growth theory. Figure 1 is an old screenshot of my research. (I do not want to spoil too much of the final results!) Figure 1: Screenshot of my research I also work on the implementation of interlinked (climate) shocks in economic models and mitigation policies. Finally, I also do work on economic inequalities related to carbon taxation. "],["michaela.html", "4 Michaela 4.1 About Me 4.2 My Research", " 4 Michaela 4.1 About Me Hello, I am Michaela. I am a Doctoral student and Researcher at the Mobiliar Lab for Analytics at the MTEC. Figure 4.1: This is me and an icy pac-man 4.2 My Research My research broadly focuses on trust in human-computer interactions. Specifically, I am interested in interpretability techniques for machine learning and their impact on user trust and decision making. The increasing ubiquity of machine learning applications in multiple sectors of society has led to a surge of interest in the development of systems that can explain their behaviour, yet many questions, such as How do we evaluate human trust in machine learning models? and In what situations do interpretability tools aid/obstruct human decision-making? remain unanswered. I believe that answering these questions requires an interdisciplinary approach, hence I build my work on methods of and prior research in the fields of Psychology, Cognitive Science, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Science. My aim is to gain a rigorous understanding of the vulnerabilities of machine learning interpretability techniques, using a human-centered approach. "]]
